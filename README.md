# Gustafgraph

## Project description
This project requires us to create an online journalling website, similar to 'telegra.ph', where users can create private journal entries.

The user will only be able to access their past entries by using the show path url provided when they create a post.

## Installation & usage
### Installation
- Clone or download the repo 

### Usage
- In the `lap2_code_challenge` folder, run `_script/startDev.sh` to start up the client, api and database.
- Open `client/index.html` in live server or use `localhost:8080` to access the main page
- Create an entry, the application will provide you with an automatically generated url path to access this post in future
- To access previously entered posts, enter the show path in the url of the site
- If you want to restart the container, run `_script/restartDev.sh` to stop the container, prune all volumes and start up the container.
